# mclx_magicwands

This mod adds one utility item; a magic wand that sorts inventories. 

Right click at the air to sort the player inventory (except hotbar), or punch a chest to sort it.

## Crafting
```
   IR ST
IR ST IR
ST IR   
```
(`IR` = iron ingot, `ST` = stick)

## Sorting methodology

1. Find all different item types in the inventory
2. Sort inventory item types by total count
3. Fit tallied and sorted items into stacks

## Notes

This is my first mod for Luanti and made for personal use. Not guaranteed to work with anything other than Mineclonia, or on any setup I am not using right now, or at all in general. There is no warranty for lost items, please have backups. I'm using this myself though so I hope I didn't leave any bugs in...
